# QtOpenGL
A sample application which implements several advanced OpenGL rendering routines.
Mostly this exists as a playground for OpenGL 3.3+ and OpenGL ES 3.0+.

# Tutorials
For those who are coming here from my Qt5+ OpenGL Tutorials, please checkout the alternative branch (tutorial-series).
The master branche is reserved for playing with advanced OpenGL features, and may or may not contain runtime issues.

# Warning
Though I attempt to do as much as I can in as clean of an implementation as possible, sometimes corners must be cut.
Because of this, never assume - unless stated otherwise - that I have rigorously tested and assure that any of the
information provided in either the master branch or tutorial-series branch is accurate. I have, to the best of my
ability, attempted to keep the tutorial-series branch relatively simple. But I have discontinued work on it because
I didn't sense that there was a strong demand past getting OpenGL up-and-running. After you have a Qt5+ project with
OpenGL rendering, it's basically an OpenGL playground at that point. Whether you're working in Qt or not, you should
be able to implement any OpenGL functionality.
